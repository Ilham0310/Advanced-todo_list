Important: Logout After Use

Remember to logout after using the Todo List App to protect your account and tasks. This is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to your account. Note that simply closing the app or refreshing the page will not log you out, so it's essential to click on the "Logout" link to ensure your account is secure.

Why Logging Out is Important

If you don't log out, your account will remain active, allowing others to access your tasks and make changes without your permission.
Logging out ensures that your account is locked and secure, protecting your personal data and tasks.
Configuration
Update the database configuration in app.config to use a different database
Notes
This app uses a SQLite database, which is not suitable for production use. Consider using a more robust database solution for a production environment.
Make sure to logout after using the app to protect your account and tasks.
